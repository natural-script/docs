#Commands
From the most exclusive features of Jste is the ability of programming in your natural local language which you speaks in your daily life.

This section is a reference to all the commands and functions which Jste supports till now.

<aside class="warning">Please don't use the experimental functions in the production, as we haven't finished buildng them yet, so using them will be very risky for your application</aside>

## Events
Most of the events in Jste English edition are started with the word <code> When </code> and end with <code> , </code> to facilitate writing and reading them and in the following you will find a list of all of these events and their descriptions:

Event | Description
----- | -----------

When it becomes in the viewport, | It is fired if the element entered the viewport.
When it becomes out of the viewport, | It is fired if the element escaped from the viewport.

## Conditional Statements

While developing your app or website using Jste Framework, you may want to specifiy conditions under which the commands will only execute and run, so Jste Framework supports the conditional statements including the mathematical comparisons and the absolute conditions as in the following:

### Mathematical Comparisons
```javascript
When it has been clicked, remove it in the case that the value of angle_field is greater than the result_field
```

Operator | Equivalent
-------- | ----------
is | ==
isn't | !=
is greater than | >
is smaller than | <

### Absolute Conditions
```javascript
When it has been clicked, remove it in the case that the device is a phone
```

Condition | Description
--------- | -----------
the keyboard is shown | Check if the On-Screen keyboard is opened ( In app mode only ).
the device is a phone | Check if the current device is a phone.
the device is a tablet | Check if the current device is a tablet.
the device is a desktop | Check if the current device is a desktop.
the bluetooth is turned on | Check if the bluetooth is turned on ( In app mode only ).
the bluetooth is turned off | Check if the bluetooth is turned off ( In app mode only ).
the WIFI is turned on | Check if the WIFI is turned on ( In app mode only ).
the WIFI is turned off | Check if the WIFI is turned off ( In app mode only ).

## Timed Commands

In many cases, you don't want to execute the commands once the event has been fired as you may want to execute it after or every a specific time, so Jste Framework offers the option to modify the timing of any command you want as in the following:

### Setting the command timeout {docsify-ignore}
```javascript
When it has been clicked, remove it after a period of 2 hours
```

To determine the time after which the command will be executed you have to write <code>after a period of THE_PERIOD_HERE</code> after the whole command as in the example.

### Setting the command time interval {docsify-ignore}
```javascript
When it has been clicked, remove it every a period of 2 hours
```

To determine the time every which the command will be executed you have to write <code>every a period of THE_PERIOD_HERE</code> after the whole command as in the example.

<aside class="note">To learn more about the period units, please refer to <a href="#time-periods">the periods section</a></aside>

## Removing Elements

<em>Script ID: S1</em><br>
You can remove any element or component programmatically while the running of your site or app through the removing commands as in the following:

### Removing the same element on which the event has been applied
```javascript
When it has been clicked, remove it
```

### Removing another element rather than the one on which the event has been applied
```javascript
When it has been clicked, remove THE_ELEMENT_NAME
```
You can remove another element rather than the one on which the event has been applied by mentioning it by its name through the command <code>remove THE_ELEMENT_NAME</code> as in the example.

# Command Studio
To make contributing to Project Jste easier and more flexible, we have designed a special tool for the contributers which is called Jste Command Studio. It gives the contributers the full oportunity to contribute to Jste with more language translations through a very simple user interface without writing any line of code. Jste Command Studio consists of two main parts: the first one is the commands builder and the second one is the dictionary builder. You can access the studio through: <a href="https://project-jste.github.io/command-studio/">https://project-jste.github.io/command-studio/</a>

## Commands Builder
Through the commands builder, anyone can contribute with more translated commands by just dragging and dropping the building blocks which can be found in the left side of the studio. Each building block of those blocks has its specific function and its specific options as it will be explained below.

### Building Blocks

#### Command
The block command is the principle block of any command as it defines some information about the command like its ID, language and example and indicates the start of a new command. All the other blocks should be attached to this mother block.

##### Options
Option | Description
------ | -----------
Script ID | It is the ID of the script or the command that you are going to translate. If you don't know the script ID, you can check it at the section of the commands above.
Language | The language to which you will translate the command.
Example | An example for using your translated command

#### String
This block is used to attach a constant phrase or string to the command.

##### Options
Option | Description
------ | -----------
String | The string that you want to enter

#### Alternatives
This block is used in the case that you want to specifiy a set of possible strings instead of just one. This gives the programmer the opportunity to choose from various ways for writing your commands.

##### Options
Option | Description
------ | -----------
Optional | It makes the whole set opeional which means that the command will work properly even if the programmer didn't written this part of the command.

#### Variable
Variable block is very important as it indicates that this part of the command is an input whose value will be captured later in the runtime.

##### Options
Option | Description
------ | -----------
Variable Name | Any label that can express the function and the benifit of that variable

#### Self Reference
No huge difference between this block and the normal string block. The only difference that this block defines a string as a self renference to the current element like the strings "its" and "their".

##### Options
Option | Description
------ | -----------
Self Reference | It is a label that express the current element.
String | The string that you want to enter.

## Dictionary Builder
Dictionary Builder is based on <a href="https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor">JSON Editor</a> to make it easier for every contributer to modify the JSON DB of the dictionary and submitting his/her contributions directly thorugh the browser. For accessing it, you have to go to Options > Jste Dictionary
